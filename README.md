## Some fun stagger effect

Stagger effect made all in React.

### Alternative to implementation using anime.js

I wanted to check if it's hard to do such effect without
the need to use some external frontend libraries (except for React'ish ofc.).

Allthough it works just fine, it needs some optimization improvements.
